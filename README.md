# Words That Are Not Used Enough
## I really am incorrigible

On social media I saw a post soliciting suggestions for words that are not
used enough. A normal person would search through their memory for words they
use and like that others use less frequently, but I'm me, which is why you are
reading this `README.md`. I downloaded the [top 60,000
lemmas](https://www.wordfrequency.info/samples.asp) data for the Corpus of
Contemporary American English which they probably don't mind me reproducing
here as they are out there for free and sorted them by frequency, ascending.
Then I picked out 20:

* hemorrhaging
* measureless
* vibrance
* desultorily (alternatively, desultory)
* cetacean
* unembellished
* misconceived
* merrymaker
* reductionistic
* intraracial
* conterminous
* crenellated
* Bacchanalian
* thralldom
* freebooter
* grotty
* injudicious
* *savoir-faire*
* facetious
* grandstanding
